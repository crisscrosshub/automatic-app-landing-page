# Mission

At CrissCross, we believe in workplace and financial empowerment for the younger generations. Teenagers face the highest rates of unemployment and underemployment among any demographic, leaving parents worrying whether or not their children can develop real-world skills with the relatively little time they have. Our solution to this problem is unique but straightforward: provide teenagers with flexible gigs in their most familiar setting: the neighborhood.

#### Tyler McNierney

Tyler McNierney is an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His first gig in high school was a piano tutoring job for a neighbor down the street, which turned out to be an incredibly rewarding experience that became an inspiration for CrissCross. Aside from piano, Tyler enjoys martial arts, dancing, writing, and skating around the neighborhood area.
